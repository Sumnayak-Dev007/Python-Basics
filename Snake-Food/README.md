# Snake Game in Python
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Python library Tkinter. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the screen borders or the snake's own body. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and the score increases.

Features
Snake Movement: The snake moves in four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
Score Tracking: The score increases each time the snake eats food.
Collision Detection: The game ends when the snake collides with the screen border or its own body.
Random Food Generation: Food is placed at random locations on the game board after every consumption.
Simple GUI: The game is built using the Tkinter library, providing a graphical user interface for interaction.
